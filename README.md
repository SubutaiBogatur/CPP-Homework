# CPP-Homework
The repository contains homeworks for C++ course in ITMO university.

ASM directory contains code written in assembler. There are a few programs there in pure assembler, they do long arithmetics operations. Moreover, there are C++ programs there with assembler inlines. They do counting number of words in string using vectorization and memory copying. Programs were written during a **C++ language** course in Spring 2016 and also during an **Assembler programming** course in Spring 2017. See [README](asm/README.md) file in asm directory for detailed information.

CPP directory contains code in C++. There are data structures, implementations of standart library functions and class for working with big integers there. Directory contains code written for an exam and just as homework also during **C++ language** course in Spring 2016, Autumn 2016. See specific [README](cpp/README.md) if interested.

The repository contains homeworks for C++ course in IFMO university.

* ASM contains some basic programs written in assembler: addition, subtraction and multiplication for long arithmetics. 

* Big Integer is a class for long arithmetics in C++. It is based on vector of unsigned integers and it is implemented using optimizations: small number optimization and copy-on-write optimization.

* LRU Cache is a data structure for storing Most Recently Used elements. If the insertion in cache is made, and the size becomes bigger, than capacity, the Least Recently Used element is deleted from cache.

* Checked class is a wrapper aroung signed and unsigned integer types, which throws the exception, if overflow happens. This class was written as a homework to learn Tag Dispatching and Traits classes.
